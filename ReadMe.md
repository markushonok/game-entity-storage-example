# Description
This project presents highly efficient data storage system for game entities from my personal projects.

# Goals
This solution aims to:
- Preserve type safety and the spirit of OO design while eliminating downcasting.
- Ensure testability of implementations and allow for easy fake generation.
- Store millions of game entities efficiently in RAM without ObjectHeaders and references overhead.

# Conventions
- GNU indentation style.
- No downcasting of objects.
- Transparent constructors and object state upon instantiation.
- Adherence to SOLID, DRY, and the Law of Demeter.
- Adherence to CQS and the project's unique principle â€” Noun-Verb Separation.
